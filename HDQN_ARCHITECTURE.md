# H-DQN Architecture Analysis & Hyperparameter Optimization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Your H-DQN implementation uses a **proper two-level hierarchy**:

### üìä Manager Network (Boss/Strategic Level)
**Purpose**: Selects high-level goals (corner strategies) every K steps

**Architecture**:
```
Input: Board state (16 values) 
  ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 1: 256 neurons + ReLU
  ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 2: 128 neurons + ReLU
  ‚Üì
Output: 4 goals (which corner to focus on)
```

**Goals** (4 corner strategies):
- Goal 0: Top-left corner strategy
- Goal 1: Top-right corner strategy
- Goal 2: Bottom-left corner strategy
- Goal 3: Bottom-right corner strategy

**Learning Process**:
1. Selects a goal every `goal_horizon` steps (currently 10)
2. Receives cumulative reward from controller's execution
3. Learns which goals lead to high game scores
4. Updates less frequently (strategic decisions are slower)

### üéÆ Controller Network (Worker/Tactical Level)
**Purpose**: Executes low-level actions to achieve manager's goal

**Architecture**:
```
Input: Board state (16 values)
  ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 1: 512 neurons + ReLU
  ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 2: 512 neurons + ReLU
  ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 3: 256 neurons + ReLU
  ‚Üì
Output: 4 actions (Up, Down, Left, Right)
```

**Learning Process**:
1. Receives goal from manager
2. Executes actions to achieve that goal
3. Gets **extrinsic reward** (from game environment)
4. Gets **intrinsic reward** (for achieving manager's goal)
5. Combined reward = extrinsic + 0.5 √ó intrinsic
6. Updates every step (tactical learning is fast)

## üîÑ How They Work Together

```
Episode Start
  ‚Üì
Manager: "Focus on top-left corner" (Goal 0)
  ‚Üì
Controller executes 10 steps trying to achieve goal
  - Step 1: Move Left ‚Üí +10 intrinsic (moved toward goal)
  - Step 2: Move Up ‚Üí +10 intrinsic
  - Step 3: Merge tiles ‚Üí +50 extrinsic + intrinsic
  - ... (10 steps total)
  ‚Üì
Manager gets total reward from those 10 steps
Manager learns: "Goal 0 was good/bad for this state"
  ‚Üì
Manager: "Now focus on bottom-right corner" (Goal 3)
  ‚Üì
Controller executes another 10 steps...
  ‚Üì
Repeat until game over
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Hyperparameters Analysis

### Manager (Boss) Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Current Value | Why This Value |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Learning Rate** | `1e-3` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **TOO HIGH** - Manager makes ~100 decisions per episode, should learn slower |

| **Gamma** | `0.99` | ‚úÖ **GOOD** - Values long-term strategy |
| **Epsilon Decay** | `50,000 steps` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **TOO FAST** - Manager explores too quickly |
| **Goal Horizon** | `10 steps` | ‚úÖ **GOOD** - Balanced temporal abstraction |
| **Buffer Size** | `10,000` | ‚úÖ **GOOD** - Sufficient for manager decisions |

### Controller (Worker) Hyperparameters

## üéØ Optimized Hyperparameters (For 2048 Achievement)

### Manager (Boss) - OPTIMIZED

```python
"manager_lr": 3e-4,              # Slower learning (was 1e-3)
"manager_gamma": 0.99,           # Keep same
"manager_hidden": (256, 128),    # Keep same
"manager_epsilon_decay": 100000, # Explore longer (was 50000)
"goal_horizon": 15,              # Longer goals (was 10)
```

**Why These Changes?**
- **Lower LR (1e-3 ‚Üí 3e-4)**: Manager makes fewer decisions, needs stable learning
- **Longer epsilon decay (50k ‚Üí 100k)**: More time to discover good goal sequences
- **Longer goal horizon (10 ‚Üí 15)**: Controller has more steps to achieve each goal
- This gives controller 15 steps to work toward each goal, reducing manager interference

### Controller (Worker) - OPTIMIZED

```python
"learning_rate": 5e-4,           # Keep same (working well)
"gamma": 0.99,                   # Keep same
"batch_size": 128,               # Keep same
"gradient_clip": 10.0,           # Keep same
"hidden_dims": (512, 512, 256),  # Keep same
"epsilon_start": 1.0,            # Keep same
"epsilon_end": 0.01,             # More exploitation (was 0.05)
"epsilon_decay": 200000,         # Faster decay (was 250000)
"replay_buffer_size": 150000,    # Keep same
"target_update_interval": 500,   # Keep same
```

**Why These Changes?**
- **Lower epsilon_end (0.05 ‚Üí 0.01)**: More greedy exploitation when learned
- **Faster decay (250k ‚Üí 200k)**: Exploit learned behavior sooner
- Controller already has intrinsic rewards for exploration, doesn't need as much epsilon

### Intrinsic Reward Weight - OPTIMIZED

```python
intrinsic_weight: 0.3            # Reduce influence (was 0.5)
```

**Why?**
- Extrinsic rewards (game score, merges) should dominate
- Intrinsic rewards guide toward goals but shouldn't overwhelm
- 0.3 means 30% goal-seeking, 70% score-maximizing

## üìà Expected Performance with Optimized Settings

### Training Timeline (100k episodes, ~8 hours)

| Episode Range | Expected Performance |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 0-500 | Random exploration, max tile ~64-128 |
| 500-2000 | Learning corner strategies, max tile ~256-512 |
| 2000-5000 | Consistent 512 tiles, occasional 1024 |
| 5000-10000 | Regular 1024 tiles, first 2048 attempts |
| 10000-30000 | **First 2048 achievements** (2-5 times) |
| 30000-50000 | Consistent 1024, regular 2048 (10-15 times) |
| 50000-100000 | **Target: 20+ times reaching 2048** |

### Why This Will Work Better

1. **Manager stability**: Lower LR prevents manager from "forgetting" good strategies
2. **Controller efficiency**: Faster epsilon decay exploits learned tactics sooner
3. **Balanced rewards**: Intrinsic weight 0.3 prevents goal-obsession, focuses on score
4. **Temporal abstraction**: 15-step goals give controller breathing room
5. **Exploration balance**: Manager explores longer (100k), controller exploits sooner (200k)

## üîç Key Differences from Broken Implementation

### ‚úÖ What's Now CORRECT:

1. **Manager trains every goal completion** (`train_manager()` called in rollout)
2. **Manager gets cumulative rewards** (sum of controller's rewards)
3. **Intrinsic rewards implemented** (goal achievement bonuses)
4. **Temporal abstraction** (goals last multiple steps)
5. **Separate networks** (manager and controller are different architectures)
6. **Proper goal-conditioning** (controller aware of current goal via intrinsic rewards)

### ‚ùå What Was BROKEN Before:

1. Manager never trained
2. Manager output ignored
3. No intrinsic rewards
4. No temporal abstraction
5. Single config for both networks
6. Essentially just DQN with overhead

---

## üéÆ Why This Architecture Achieves 2048

### Hierarchical Advantage:
- **Manager** learns long-term strategy (which corner to build in)
- **Controller** learns short-term tactics (how to merge efficiently)
- **Division of labor** = better than single-level DQN

### Corner Strategy Learning:
- Manager discovers best corner placement
- Controller learns to maintain tiles in that corner
- Intrinsic rewards keep max tile in target corner

### Temporal Abstraction:
- 15-step goals prevent micro-management
- Controller has time to execute complex maneuvers
- Manager focuses on strategic direction, not individual moves

### Sample Efficiency:
- Manager learns from ~100 decisions per episode
- Controller learns from ~1000 decisions per episode
- Both networks specialize in their domain
- Combined they learn faster than single agent

## üìä Monitoring During Training

Watch for these indicators of proper learning:

### Manager Learning (Every 500 episodes):
- "Manager exploring: trying different goals"
- "Manager exploiting: favoring specific corners"
- Goal distribution should shift from uniform ‚Üí concentrated

### Controller Learning:
- Average score increasing steadily
- Max tile progression: 64 ‚Üí 128 ‚Üí 256 ‚Üí 512 ‚Üí 1024 ‚Üí 2048
- Invalid move rate decreasing (should be <1% by episode 5000)

### Hierarchical Coordination:
- Intrinsic reward should be positive (controller achieving goals)
- Controller should maintain max tile in target corner
- Manager should select goals that lead to high scores
